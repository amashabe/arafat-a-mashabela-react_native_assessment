technology stack:
    firebase (authentication and database)
    expo v~50.0.7
    react-native-extended-stylesheet
    react-navigation
    redux

i chose firebase for auth and database, including redux for state management and react-navigation for navigation between the app(including auth logic).
react-native-extended-stylesheet for scaling per screen 
react-native-snap-carousel for different screen for todo, in progress and done
react-native-dotenv to musk the configuration just to add more security
